## Create your chatbot by setting up a Watson Assistant instance

We show you how to create a chatbot using Watson Assistant, a tool that enables you to build conversational interfaces into any application, device, or channel.

1. In the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant), navigate to the Services and provision an instance of **Watson Assistant**.

## Integrate your chatbot with data sources

Now that you've created your Watson Assistant-enabled chatbot, you need to connect it to a data source. The following section shows you how to do that by adding webhooks to Watson Assistant that query for dynamic data.

Our crisis communication chatbot uses three different data sources:

- [Watson Discovery](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-discovery)
- [COVID-19 API](https://covid19api.com/)

### Defining webhooks

First, let's look at what webhooks do. A *webhook* is a mechanism that allows you to call out to an external program based on something happening in your program. When used in a dialog skill, a webhook is triggered when the assistant processes a node that has a webhook enabled. The webhook collects data that you specify or that you collect from the user during the conversation and saves in context variables.

It sends the data as part of a HTTP POST request to the URL that you specify as part of your webhook definition. The URL that receives the webhook is the listener. It performs a predefined action using the information that you pass to it as specified in the webhook definition, and can optionally return a response.

### Make use of Watson Discovery to get news information

1. From your IBM Cloud account, go to Watson Discovery.

    ![Discover Service](images/discovery-service.png)

2. Create a new lite service by clicking **Create**.

    ![Create Discover Service](images/create-discovery-service.png)

3. Make note of the API key and the URL. You need that in the next steps.

    ![Credentials](images/discovery-credentials.png)

4. Open the Watson Discovery NEWS service, which is a prepopulated discovery dataset updated and maintained by the Watson Discovery team.

    ![Watson Discovery NEWS](images/watson-discovery-news.png)

5. From the top right corner, open the API tab. Make note of the Collection ID and Environment ID.

    ![NEWS Api info](images/news-api-info.png)

### Create Cloud Functions

1. In the IBM Cloud catalog, go to [IBM Cloud Functions](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions/).

1. Click **Start Creating**.

    ![functions](images/cloud-functions.png)

1. Select **Create Action**.

    ![create](images/create-action.png)

1. Name your action. For the Runtime dropdown, select **Node.js 10**.

    ![environment](images/create-action-env.png)

1. Replace the code with [data/covid-webhook.js](https://github.com/fawazsiddiqi/EnhanceComm/blob/master/data/covid-webhook.js)

    ![code](images/code.png)

1. Our code has two main parts. We decide whether to call the COVID-19 API or Watson Discovery based on a parameter sent on the function call. If a query param of `type=api` is set, you call the COVID-19 api on the [summary endpoint](https://api.covid19api.com/summary).

    It returns the data in the following format:

    ```
    {
      Countries: [
        {
          Country: "",
          Slug: "",
          NewConfirmed: 0,
          TotalConfirmed: 0,
          NewDeaths: 0,
          TotalDeaths: 0,
          NewRecovered: 0,
          TotalRecovered: 0
        },
        {
          Country: " Azerbaijan",
          Slug: "-azerbaijan",
          NewConfirmed: 0,
          TotalConfirmed: 0,
          NewDeaths: 0,
          TotalDeaths: 0,
          NewRecovered: 0,
          TotalRecovered: 0
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

1. If you want to make a call to the Discovery service, you need to set some parameters that let you call the IAM-enabled service. On the left, click on the **Parameters** tab. Add the following parameters:

    - `api_key`(Discovery API key)
    - `url` (URL to your Discovery service instance)
    - `collection_id`
    - `env_id`

    ![parameters](images/parameter.png)

1. Enable the action as a web action. To do so, select the **Endpoints** tab on the left. Click the checkbox beside **Enable as Web Action.**

    ![endpoint](images/endpoint.png)

1. Make note of the HTTP URL. You will use this as the webhook for your assistant. You will have to add `.json` in the end of this URL to make it work as a webhook.

    ![http endpoint](images/http.png)

### Integrate data sources via a Watson Assistant webhook

For detailed instructions on how to integrate data sources via a webhook, check out our documentation: [Making Programmatic Calls from Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-webhooks).

Here are the specific steps to add a webhook to your COVID-19 chatbot.

1. Bring up the COVID-19 assistant you created earlier. Find it in your IBM Cloud account under Services > IBM Watson Assistant. Open the dialog by clicking the `CDC COVID FAQ` Dialog.

    ![View Watson Assistant](images/assistant.png)

1. Click on **Options** on the left.

    ![options](images/options.png)

1. Under Options > Webhooks, in the URL text box, paste the URL from the Cloud Funciton step. Make sure to add a `.json` at the end of the URL.

    ![url](images/add-url.png)

1. Select **Dialog** on the left navigation.

    ![dialog](images/dialog.png)

1. Open up any dialog node you want to add a webhook call for.

1. After selecting the node, click **Customize**.

    ![customize](images/customize.png)

1. Enable your webhooks by moving the toggle button to **On** in the Webhooks section. Click **Save**.

    ![webhooks](images/enable-webhook.png)

1. Add any parameter your webhook needs. These will be sent as query parameters.

    ![webhook parameters](images/webhook-parameter.png)

1. Test that your webhook integration is working by going to the **Try It** tab and initiating a dialog that calls the webhook.

    ![webhook test](images/webhook-test.png)

You can easily use webhooks to give your Watson Assistant access to many external APIs and databases.
